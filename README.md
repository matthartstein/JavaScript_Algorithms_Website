This program uses basic HTML and JavaScript to render a webpage that tests my implementations for the following algorithms:

- reverseArray()
- findMin()
- stringFromArrays()
- applyToArray()
- computeMaxArr()
- makeClosure()

Tests knowledge in recursive algorithms, higher order functions, and common closures.
